# E-Commerce-Data-Manipulation-using-RPA
E-commerce data manipulation using RPA is an automation project that will produce the various book details using ISBN number to clients via e-mail. When we search for a particular book using ISBN number in any e-commerce website, the result is not ready for consumption and is not clearly formatted. ISBN refers to International Standard Book Number. This project enables various E-Commerce websites to reap loads of benefits from the RPA software robots as these kind of activities can be fully automated without the intervention of any human being at all. It reduces the time and effort required to drill down the relevant book information and collates the automated results in excel which is easy to consume, visualize and understand by the clients. It also automates the mail that is sent by the clients and saves the attachment of input files required for the project. Atlast, the business file which is generated is sent via mail to the clients using RPA.

~Module Splitup

Module 1: Input Business File Module 2: Search the required ISBN number Module 3: Web manipulation and extraction Module 4: Business file report generation Module 5: File transfer via e-mail

~Advantages over existing methods

The results of E-Commerce search using RPA are in well documented format.
Time consumption is reduced.
The automated results will be produced in excel format which is easy to visualize and understand.
Minimal man power consumption.
Computational errors and mistakes are minimized.

~Future Enhancements

The initial data which is not in documented form can be converted to Business file and can be exported via mail to required customer.
The resultant excel sheet can be uploaded to moodle or any other educational website which is useful for the reference of students.
